######################## Tweet Classifier ##########################

Description:

Project to build a model which is able to classify tweets based upon their "positivity"

The project consists of XX codes which are run in order

##############################################################

Code:
  
    1-4) Scraping data from twitter and cleaning the data into a format that can
    be used by the word2vec. Due to the nature of the twitter of twitter API only 
    ~2000 tweets can be downloaded every 15 minutes. Therefore codes 1-3 were 
    needed to be run multiple times
    
    5) Building of word2vec model
    
    6-7) Visualisation and analysis of the word2vec model which are used to
    optimise the model
    
    8) Creation of categories to group each word from the tweets into
    
    9) Creates a dataset by counting the number of words from each tweet which 
    are classified into each category based on their cosine similarity
